    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sequence $n^2+3$ with $n \\geq 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we write down the first terms of this sequence we get: $4,7,12,19,28,39,52,67,84,103,124,147,172,199,228,259,292,327,364,\\ldots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the terms for $n = 6$ and $n = 7$ (39 and 52) are both divisible by 13. In fact 13 is the largest prime dividing any two successive terms of this sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P(k)$ be the largest prime that divides any two successive terms of the sequence $n^2+k^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the last 18 digits of $\\sum_{k=1}^{10000000} P(k)$."

    "## Preliminary investigation\n",
    "If the nth term of the sequence can be written as $n^2 + k^2$ then the subsequent term can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(n+1)^2 + k^2 = n^2 + k^2 + 2n + 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n^2 + k^2$ can be divided by an integer, $p$, then $2n + 1$ must also be divisable by $p$, otherwise $(n+1)^2 + k^2$ cannot be divisable by $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = \\frac{n^2 + k^2}{2n + 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "will be an integer. Solving this for $n$ while assuming $k$ and $m$ positive yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = \\sqrt{m^2 - k^2 + m} + m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n$ to come out as an integer, the expression under the square root must be a square number. This is easily seen to be true when $m = k^2$, which yields $n = 2k^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I am going to conjecture that there are no other integer solutions to the equation. This means that we need to find the largest prime factor for each $4k^2 + 1$ for each value of $k$ between $1$ and $10^7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be solved with [trial division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division). For each $k$, we loop over the primes $< \\sqrt{4k^2 + 1}$ to see if they divide $4k^2 + 1$. If, at the end, what remains of $4k^2 + 1$ is a $1$ it means that the largests of the generated primes is the largest prime factor. If the remainder is $> 1$ it means that the remainder itself is the largest prime factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point is because if you have $p \\times q = n$ where both $p$ and $q$ are primes, one of the factors must be $< \\sqrt{n}$. If one does trial division of all primes up to $\\sqrt{n}$, that means that if whatever remains is $> 1$ it must be prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one last optimisation I noticed, empirically, that the only primes, $p$, that divide $4k^2 + 1$ are those where $(p - 1) \\mod 4 = 0$. This optimisation is included into the algorithm"
